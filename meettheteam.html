            <h1>Behind the Prints: A Family Affair</h1>
            <p>
                While the machines do the heavy lifting, the heart of our business is found in the everyday chaos and joy of our family life. Our workshop isn't just a place for manufacturing; it’s a space where we gather to solve problems, spark creativity, and learn the value of a job well done. From the dining room table to the printer bench, we’ve turned our 2024 hobby into a hands-on lesson in entrepreneurship for our children. Every project we take on is a team effort, fueled by curiosity, a little bit of "middle-school" logic, and the goal of building something meaningful together. We aren't just shipping out plastic and resin—we’re sharing a piece of our family’s journey with you.

                <h2>The Founder & Lead Maker (Dad)</h2>
                <p>The one who received the fateful gift in 2024. I handle the technical side of the shop—from 3D modeling and slicer settings to keeping the printers running smoothly. My favorite part of the job is watching a digital file become a physical object and teaching my kids that if they can imagine it, we can print it.</p>

                <h2>Chief Quality Officer (Evan)</h2>
                <p>As the eldest, he has the keenest eye for detail. He is responsible for inspecting finished prints, removing support structures, and ensuring that every item meets our "family-standard" before it heads to the shipping station. If it isn't perfect, it doesn't leave the shop.</p>

                <p>He keeps the gears turning by managing our filament stock and packaging. He’s learning the "ins and outs" of shipping, calculating costs, and making sure we have the supplies we need to fulfill every order on time. He’s the reason your package arrives safely and organized.</p>

                <p>The youngest member of the crew! While he’s mostly in charge of napping and moral support, he’s the reason we started this journey. He reminds us every day why we are building this family legacy and keeps the "vibe" in the workshop light and happy.</p>
