          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p class="intro">I’m Luis — a father of four and a lifelong tinkerer who believes the best way to learn is by doing.</p>
          <p>After receiving a 3D printer as a life‑changing Christmas gift in 2024, my dining room quickly transformed into a family workshop. What began as a personal hobby soon became a shared space for experimenting, building, and discovering what modern manufacturing can do.</p>
          <p>Today, my mission is to show my kids — and our community — the incredible possibilities that come from curiosity and hands‑on learning. When I’m not calibrating bed levels or testing new filaments, I’m teaching my children the ropes of entrepreneurship and making sure every project we ship is a team effort.</p>
          <p> The spark for this entire venture actually came from one of my sons. His fascination with 3D printing planted the seed, but it was my wife who turned that curiosity into a reality. In a whirlwind of holiday spirit in 2024, she decided to surprise me with our very first printer. She placed the order just six days before Christmas, and in what felt like a holiday miracle, it arrived on our doorstep on Christmas Eve. That gift was more than just a new hobby—it was the beginning of a family legacy that we now grow together every single day.</p>
          <p class="callout"> We build things together - and we learn together</p>
